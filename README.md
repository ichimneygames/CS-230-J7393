The gaming room client, who is Creative Technology Solutions, wanted a multiplatform game that worked accross phones and other PC related OS. I think I did well in developing the different benefits each of the OS's would have. I talked about each one and how the servers would act and how much they would cost. Furthermore talking about the coding abilities on each one and continuing into the negatives of them as well. I think the ability to look back and continue working on code after thinking about it in a non code sense. After finishing a programming session, just being able to think afterwords helped clear up some issues i might have run into. I would pick the ending portion to probably revise. Since I did it after most of the code was done, I didnt look back on the code to answer most of those questions, more or less ansering from money. I interpreted the needs by just looking at what they wanted and how to relate it to code. It is important to consider the user needs beacuse if you dont, you more or less are not following any design that is wanted and can make it harder for fixes down the road when the final product has no related prototypes. I approached this very slowly. Im not good with coding so I needed more time to actually understand what I was doing, and even then its not fully submitted into my head. I would use the internet and look at similar products through youtube to help redirect me into the right path.
